# Neural Network Implementations in Python

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing implementations of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using Python. Each notebook is extensively commented to explain the logic, concepts, and functions used in building and training these networks. More content will be added progressively.

## Notebooks
1. **`ANN01.ipynb`**: Implementation of a implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN).


## Future Additions
This repository will continue to expand with additional notebooks covering various neural network architectures, such as deep learning models, reinforcement learning, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-python.git
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Open the desired notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the comments and explanations within the notebook to understand the neural network implementation.
